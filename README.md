# Project 3 of Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree: Therapeutic Foods
## Hosted
at http://ec2-34-208-105-239.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/
## How to Run the Application

0. First install Python and Vagrant
1. At a directory, 'git clone {my project git url}',
2. cd to the project directory, run 'vagrant init ubuntu/trusty32'
3. At the project directory, run 'vagrant up', then 'vagrant ssh'
4. Inside vagrant: cd /vagrant/FoodsTherapy; at the master branch, run 'python
   finalProject.py'; follow the vm prompt to fetch the pin from imgur.com and enter it
   at the vm prompt; Further follow the direction of the vagrant VM and open the browser
   at address: localhost:5000.
5. To start with a clean database, do the following inside vagrant at /vagrant/Foods
   Therapy:
  - python database_setup.py
  - python manyRestaurants.py
  - python finalProject.py; follow the vm prompt to fetch the pin as in step 4 above.
6. When creating menuItem, upload the image from the project directory.

## Features of My Application
1. A user will authenticate the app usage by either facebook or google+ authentication.
   The user will also fetch a pin from the imgur site after running finalProject.py to
   upload image at imgur and populate the image property of menuitem in the database.
2. A logged-in user can create, edit, and delete restaurants, the menus offered by his
   or her own restaurant, and a list of health conditions that couple with recommended
   menus.
3. A non-registered user can look through the restaurants, menu and conditions tabs without
   logging in. The user can find menus offered by a partiuclar restaurant, menus
   recommended for certain health conditions, and a list of all the menus created by all
   users.
